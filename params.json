  "body": "### What is Phink ?\r\nPhink Framework is a component oriented PHP framework. It allows you to build sites like ASP.Net webform does with its user controls and master pages all in benefiting of an MVC architecture. It integrates a client-side layer in shape of a JavaScript API that looks very much like the PHP classes. This coupled solution is aiming to easily build Single Page Applications. A simple JavaScript starter statement can launch the entire application. Also, Phink contains different levels of security (Injection safety, CORS, HSTS) and cache (dynamic, pseudo-dynamic, static), etc. \r\n\r\n",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
